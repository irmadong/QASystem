<LEADPARA>  If he were playing this season, the Iron Horse would easily surpass the Rocket
on payday.;    So says a study released Tuesday by two University of Dayton
economics professors, who theorize that Lou Gehrig's performance and years of
service would make him deserving of the highest salary in baseball history if
he played in today's market.  </LEADPARA>

HIS '91 SALARY: $7.8 MILLION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "It is probably impossible to ever objectively rank the all-time players on
the basis of their pure baseball athletic skills, but if a player with Lou
Gehrig's statistical capabilities emerged in the 1991 baseball labor market,
he should be the highest-paid player," said Lawrence Hadley, one of the
study's authors.;    Hadley and Elizabeth Gustafson calculated that Gehrig
would command an annual salary of more than $7.8 million in today's market.
Pitcher Walter Johnson would be second, earning more than $7.5 million per
year.;    Boston Red Sox pitcher Roger "The Rocket" Clemens is the
highest-paid player today, earning an average of $5.38 million a year.;    The
two researchers studied the records of 150 hitters and 100 pitchers,
calculating what the players would earn if they were free agents in the prime
of their careers and were rewarded for their performance and longevity at the
same rate as today's players.;    Third on the list was Babe Ruth at $7.5
million, followed by Jimmie Foxx, $7.3 million, and Cy Young, $7.1 million.  </TEXT>
